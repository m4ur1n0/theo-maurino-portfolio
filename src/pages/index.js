          Hello! Thanks for visiting my site. My name is Theo Maurino. Iâ€™m a fullstack developer who is deeply passionate about security in the software engineering lifecycle. I love building software and digital tools, and I have several projects that prove it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 10 years old, starting off building little math tools in Python, but always dreaming of something bigger. Today, Iâ€™m a CS student at Northwestern University, and Iâ€™m still building. I co-founded a cybersecurity startup providing pro-bono posture analyses to local businesses in Evanston, IL, while certifying students for free. Iâ€™ve built social media apps, productivity tools, and a litany of other projects with a variety of tech stacks. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I have a passion for software engineering that truly eclipses all my other interests, but on the rare occasion that Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me reading a collection of short stories, playing Catan, chess, or cribbage, or cooking with friends.
